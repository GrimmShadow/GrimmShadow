- 👋 Hi, I’m @GrimmShadow
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Music (used to be a composer, studied at Berklee College of Music), Computers (OBVIOUSLY), and absolutely my sexy wife.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... IT Automation with Python, with an end goal of Software Engineer/ DevOps
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing, at the moment. I want to know what I'm doing, first!
- 📫 How to reach me ... ask.
- 😄 Pronouns: If you know CORRECT grammar, then you KNOW my pronouns
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I'm a decendant of Beltsa The Trojan Lady of Asgard, who was married to the King of Saxony, Turkey, and Sweden.
-             Fun fact part 2: My son's name litterally means Royal Decendant. Ironically named before we found out we were decended from royalty
